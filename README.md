# Soundless
This is a sound feedback app we created for COGS 120.

Soundless is a hearing health prototype that notifies users if they have been exposed to loud noises for a long period of time as people only care about their hearing once they lose it.

We recommend running our app on a mobile device using the link provided above or using your localhost.
